## Bussiness Problems and SQL Solutions

    type,
    COUNT(*) 
FROM netflix 
GROUP BY type;
```
### 2.Find the Most Common Ratings for Movies and TV Shows

SELECT 
    type,
    rating
FROM (
    SELECT 
        type, 
        rating, 
        COUNT(*) AS count_rating,
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY type ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS ranking
    FROM netflix
    GROUP BY type, rating
) AS ranked
WHERE ranking = 1;
```

### 3.List All Movies Released in the Year 2020

    release_year 
FROM netflix 
WHERE release_year = 2020 AND type = 'Movie';
```

### 4.Find Top 5 Countries with the Most Content

```sql
SELECT 
    TRIM(UNNEST(STRING_TO_ARRAY(country, ','))) AS country, 
    COUNT(*) AS total_count
FROM netflix
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY total_count DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

### 5.Identify the Longest Movie on Netflix

```sql
SELECT
    type,
    title,
    duration,
    SPLIT_PART(duration, ' ', 1)::INT AS minutes
FROM netflix
WHERE type = 'Movie' AND duration ILIKE '%min%'
ORDER BY minutes DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

### 6. Find All Content Added in the Last 5 Years

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM netflix
WHERE TO_DATE(date_added, 'Month DD, YYYY') >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '5 years';
```

### 7.Find All Movies or TV Shows Directed by Rajiv Chilaka
